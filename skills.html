                    <h2>Soft skills</h2>
                    <p>
                        First about my communication skills, I am someone that is more about listening 
                        than speaking. Speaking only when it matters. I can show some non-verbal 
                        communication and I show respect to anyone no matter who they are. Presentation 
                        is, for me, one of the most important thing to have in life, everything is good 
                        when it is presented the way they should be. A good presentation is always the 
                        start of a success. Although, I was shy when I was young, one of the reason I am 
                        not very talkative, that shyness disappeared little by little, today I feel 
                        comfortable whenever I need to do some public speaking. And, since I am not very 
                        talkative, I have a very good writing skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, my critical thinking, I can easily adapt myself to the current situation. 
                        With that comes a great desire to learn and good creativity. For me, life is about 
                        learning new things everyday, discovering so much knowledge, cultures. We never 
                        stop learning, and there is no limit for it. When working, I like doing my research, 
                        and thing logically with flexibility. Whenever there is an issue, I like doing the 
                        troubleshooting independently since I like being independent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Third, about collaboration, although I like being independent, collaboration is the 
                        key for a team success, and when it is needed I am always happy to join it. Whenever 
                        there is a good or a bad feedback, I always take it for my self improvement. Also, I 
                        know that during a debate, there is no concurrence but only partners who are looking f
                        or the best solution, so for me emotional intelligence is important. I am always trying 
                        to improve my self-awareness. And about positive attitude, I have always been someone 
                        who is honest with the others, I do respect everyone, and sometime I am the one who 
                        is that person with humor in a group.
                    </p>

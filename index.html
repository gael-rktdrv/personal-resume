                        Hello, welcome to this web page, my name is Onja RAKOTONDRAVELO, I am a freshly graduate from 
                        the University of Bordeaux, France with a Master of Science in Aircraft Engineering and Maintenance. 
                        Probably, you are aware of the situation of the aircraft industry at this moment. Because of that, 
                        I have decided to do a complete professional reorientation in term of career goals and projects 
                        keep developing into that field.  
                    </p>
                    <p style=" padding-bottom: 40px;">
                        I have always been interested in programming, and since I was working in data development in Airbus, 
                        I have decided to pursue a path of data scientist. My actual plan know to find a job or an internship 
                        that can allow me to get some experience in data science and get to the advanced level. 
                    </p>

                <h2>About my non-typical path</h2>
                    <h3>Saint-Petersburg</h3>
                        <p>
                            Back in 2011, I graduated from high 
                            school with a very good result (but there is nothing to be proud of). Back then, I was 
                            proposed to apply for scholarship program to study abroad. I did have many choice to begin
                            with but the first answer I have got was studying in Russia. So in September 2012 I left 
                            my home country for a country that was barely known by myself. We were a group of ten (10) 
                            young students who were part of the scholarship program. Everybody, of course, had their 
                            own university but, we were the ones chosen from few hundreds students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So we arrived in Moscow at night, I barely remember the time, but it was already dark. An 
                            official from the embassy of Madagascar in Moscow met us (He was a country-mate) but he 
                            rapidly left us on the hands of two Russians, who didn't know how to speak English. In 
                            other hand, we did no know how to speak Russian. So, the adventure began, with no 
                            understanding of each other. After that, I spent one year in Saint Petersburg studying the 
                            russian language. It was a very rich experience for me during that time. I visited some of 
                            the most famous places of the city such as “The hermitage museum”, “Peter and Paul’s fortress”, 
                            “Peterghof” and so more.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Samara</h3>
                        <p>
                            I had to leave Saint-Petersburg at the end of july 2013 for another city, where my university
                            was. So I arrived to Samara, I met few country-mates there. I began my bachelor program in 
                            Aircraft Engineering. I got my degree in 2018 and had the chance to watch some of the matches
                            of the 2018 World Cup. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Samara was the city where I lived the main part of my life, about five years. I started 
                            to have a big interest towards working out and gym. I started going to the gym by the end 
                            of 2015, and I ended up actually liking the life of so called “wellness”. At my peak, I 
                            could bench 100 kg, squat 140 kg and dead-lift 160 kg. What a guy may you say, but it was 
                            not that impressive if you had seen other big men who could crush anything with bare hand. 
                            But working out is not about competition with others, but more like competition with 
                            yourself. Always being better than what you were yesterday. Always surpass what you did 
                            the day or the week before.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3>France</h3>
                        <p>
                            At the end of September 2018, I left Russia for France to pursue a Master degree program in 
                            Aircraft Engineering. I got to work as an intern in a laboratory of the university by the 
                            end of the same year. One year after, I’ve been chosen for an apprenticeship program in Airbus
                            as a  data analyst. Eventually, at the end of the year 2019, I thought I have succeeded but 
                            life said: “No, wait a minute”, covid-19 appeared. It crushed the entire world so fast that 
                            some of the industries are  still trying to stand at this moment, and so did my dreams. That’s 
                            why I have moved on and tried to transfer my knowledge into another field, so I began learning 
                            by myself advanced programming with python. I did a bootcamp on Data Science to get the main 
                            ideas behind the sexiest job of the 21th century. Then I enrolled on a certification program 
                            from MIT on Machine Learning. Actually, I am pursuing a MicroMaster in Data Science and Big 
                            Data Analytics from UC San Diego, and at the same time, practicing on kaggle, and learning 
                            frontend tools.

                        Machine learning methods are commonly used across engineering and sciences, from computer systems to physics. 
                        Moreover, commercial sites such as search engines, recommender systems, advertisers, and financial institutions 
                        employ machine learning algorithms for content recommendation, predicting customer behavior, compliance, or risk. 
                        As a discipline, machine learning tries to design and understand computer programs that learn from experience for

                       The objectives relate to engineering and maintenance in aeronautics. More specifically, operational maintenance, which
                       consists of defining maintenance and repair operations to ensure regulatory compliance and operational readiness 
                       of an aircraft in a given fleet. This constitutes the first level of industrial activity such as understand the behavior 
                       of structures under different stresses (fatigue, ablative flow and radiation in the spatial context). Identify 
                       the resulting degradation by using expert appraisals and diagnostic methods. Also, define the methodological aspects of 
                       repairs, as well as modeling and the optimization of these repairs then Carry out the validation tests in accordance 
                       with the regulations in force. One of the main part is also, knowing the manuals for common repair techniques.

                <h2>ATR/Airbus: Data Analyst</h2>
                <p>
                    My main experience was as a data analyst at ATR, I was in charge of analysis of a large 
                    dataset of aircraft maintenance reports. ATR, as they are aircraft designer and 
                    constructor, have multiple partnerships with other companies. Some of those companies 
                    are MRO (Maintenance Repair Overhall), those kind of companies have the role of doing 
                    the maintenance of aircraft. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Few things about the aircraft industry
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In the aircraft industry, every modifications, every step linked to any process that 
                    concerns an aircraft is recorded and so ins the process of aircraft maintenance. In 
                    one hand, the EASA, an European authority, that is in charge of the regularization of 
                    aircraft design, construction, operation issues most of the constraints that should be 
                    applied on every type of aircraft (in Europe) . In the other hand, aircraft manufacturer 
                    such as Airbus or ATR, issues the documentation that concerns the process linked to 
                    their specific aircraft. Just to name a few of them:
                    <ul class="b">
                        <li>MRBR: Maintenance Review Board Report</li>
                        <li>MPD: Maintenance Planning Document</li>
                        <li>IPC: Illustration Part Catalog</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aircraft industry has a very strict regulation, and that resulted to a very high 
                    level of safety (Air transportation being the safest way of traveling).
                </p>
                <h3>
                    My work at ATR
                </h3>
                <p>
                    So back to my work, I had to retrieve every kind of information that could be used from 
                    these reports. The reports themselves included: the maintenance duration, the default 
                    description, the parts changed, the tasks. So, from those information, I could get a 
                    model of maintenance cost over aircraft age, redundancy of defaults, and most costing 
                    tasks.

                <h2>I2M laboratory: Data analyst trainee</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was about studying the characteristics of the interface made with metal 
                    and elastomer., working mainly with Matlab, I worked on image processing to do 
                    measurement. 
                    During the first part of the project, we would test and measure the elastomer characteristics 
                    on a specific stand, with specific software, and taking picture at the same time. Then the 
                    second part is to measure the elongation of the elastomer sample with Matlab. The third step 
                    is to compare the software measurement with the matlab results.
                    For second part of the projects, we would them do the same operation but only with different 
                    kind of samples, an elastomer stuck with a piece of metal. And for the second part, we would 
                    use different samples, with different artificial aging process. That part allowed us to 
                    measure the effect of aging for the interface and let us know how does it behave with time.

                        and think logically with flexibility. Whenever there is an issue, I like doing the <b>troubleshooting independently</b> since I like 
                        being independent. Last but not the least,  collaboration, although I like being independent, <b>collaboration is the key</b> for 
                        a team success, and when it is needed I am always happy to join.

                    <h3>Data Science</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            As I mentioned earlier, I am actually doing a reconversion from being an aircraft engineer to be a data scientist. I have 
                            chosen it because, I want to transfer what I have learned during my apprenticeship to be the basis of my career objectives. 
                            At this time, I can work with the following programming languages:
                            <ul style="list-style: square inside; margin-left: 20px">
                                <li>Python with advanced level on OOP conception, hardware acceleration with multithreading and multiprocessing;</li>
                                <li>Matlab with a good level in scripting;</li>
                                <li>VBA/Excel for automation of Excel sheets;</li>
                                <li>SQL for queries from databases.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With Python as my main tool, I can work with the following frameworks:
                            <ul style="list-style: square inside; margin-left: 20px">
                                <li>Pandas, NumPy, OpenPyxl, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PySpark for data acqusition, data wrangling, data mining;</li>
                                <li>Scikit Learn, StatsModels, Pytorch for machine learning modeling;</li>
                                <li>Jupyter Notebooks, VSCode, GitHub as IDE platform for CI/CD;</li>
                                <li>Bokeh, MS Office, Canva for data vizualization and reporting;</li>
                                <li>Linux(Debian Based), Windows as OS and work environment.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    <h3>Aircraft Engineering</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            As an aircraft engineer, my knowledge are very rich, working with <b>aircraft documentation</b> such as the EASA Part 21, CS 25, 
                            working on <b>continuous airworthiness management</b>. I also have some knowledge in <b>integrated logistic support</b> and  <b>life cycle 
                            cost</b>. Not neglecting Structure design and Repair <b>CATIA V5</b> and <b>KOMPAS 3D</b> and Computation and Simulation with <b>Hypermesh</b> and 
                            Finite elements methods. And finally, <b>Aircarft maintenance</b> (Line and base maintenance management), Aircraft system maintenance 
                            (hydraulic, oil, fuel, landing gear) and Engine maintenance.

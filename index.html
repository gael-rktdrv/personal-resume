                        Hello, welcome to this web page, my name is Onja RAKOTONDRAVELO, I am a freshly graduate from 
                        the University of Bordeaux, France with a Master of Science in Aircraft Engineering and Maintenance. 
                        Probably, you are aware of the situation of the aircraft industry at this moment. Because of that, 
                        I have decided to do a complete professional reorientation in term of career goals and projects 
                        keep developing into that field.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have always been interested in programming, and since I was working in data development in Airbus, 
                        I have decided to pursue a path of data scientist. My actual plan know to find a job or an internship 
                        that can allow me to get some experience in data science and get to the advanced level. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br style="clear:both;"/>
                <div>
                    <h2>About my non-typical path</h2>
                        <h3>Saint-Petersburg</h3>
                        <p>
                            Back in 2011, I graduated from high 
                            school with a very good result (but there is nothing to be proud of). Back then, I was 
                            proposed to apply for scholarship program to study abroad. I did have many choice to begin
                            with but the first answer I have got was studying in Russia. So in September 2012 I left 
                            my home country for a country that was barely known by myself. We were a group of ten (10) 
                            young students who were part of the scholarship program. Everybody, of course, had their 
                            own university but, we were the ones chosen from few hundreds students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So we arrived in Moscow at night, I barely remember the time, but it was already dark. An 
                            official from the embassy of Madagascar in Moscow met us (He was a country-mate) but he 
                            rapidly left us on the hands of two Russians, who didn't know how to speak English. In 
                            other hand, we did no know how to speak Russian. So, the adventure began, with no 
                            understanding of each other. After that, I spent one year in Saint Petersburg studying the 
                            russian language. It was a very rich experience for me during that time. I visited some of 
                            the most famous places of the city such as “The hermitage museum”, “Peter and Paul’s fortress”, 
                            “Peterghof” and so more.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                        <h3>Samara</h3>
                        <p>
                            I had to leave Saint-Petersburg at the end of july 2013 for another city, where my university
                            was. So I arrived to Samara, I met few country-mates there. I began my bachelor program in 
                            Aircraft Engineering. I got my degree in 2018 and had the chance to watch some of the matches
                            of the 2018 World Cup. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Samara was the city where I lived the main part of my life, about five years. I started 
                            to have a big interest towards working out and gym. I started going to the gym by the end 
                            of 2015, and I ended up actually liking the life of so called “wellness”. At my peak, I 
                            could bench 100 kg, squat 140 kg and dead-lift 160 kg. What a guy may you say, but it was 
                            not that impressive if you had seen other big men who could crush anything with bare hand. 
                            But working out is not about competition with others, but more like competition with 
                            yourself. Always being better than what you were yesterday. Always surpass what you did 
                            the day or the week before.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                        <h3>France</h3>
                        <p>
                            At the end of September 2018, I left Russia for France to pursue a Master degree program in 
                            Aircraft Engineering. I got to work as an intern in a laboratory of the university by the 
                            end of the same year. One year after, I’ve been chosen for an apprenticeship program in Airbus
                            as a  data analyst. Eventually, at the end of the year 2019, I thought I have succeeded but 
                            life said: “No, wait a minute”, covid-19 appeared. It crushed the entire world so fast that 
                            some of the industries are  still trying to stand at this moment, and so did my dreams. That’s 
                            why I have moved on and tried to transfer my knowledge into another field, so I began learning 
                            by myself advanced programming with python. I did a bootcamp on Data Science to get the main 
                            ideas behind the sexiest job of the 21th century. Then I enrolled on a certification program 
                            from MIT on Machine Learning. Actually, I am pursuing a MicroMaster in Data Science and Big 
                            Data Analytics from UC San Diego, and at the same time, practicing on kaggle, and learning 
                            frontend tools.
